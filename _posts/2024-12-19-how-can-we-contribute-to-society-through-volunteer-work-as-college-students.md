Ladies and Gentlemen,               

Today my topic is about “Volunteering and social responsibility.” Volunteering is the heartbeat of a vibrant society. As volunteers, we’re a part of a larger community and our actions, no matter how small, can ignite a flame of hope and inspire a wave of positive change.                         

In the bustling city of Shanghai, we-commuters see Red Vests everyday in Shanghai Metro. One day, on my way to college I took the Metro Line 15. I walked as usual and didn’t notice a passenger who was blind until a Red Vest came with a microphone and a guiding stick. I watched this guy, with gentle words and kind guidance, assisted the blind passenger leaving safely from the station exit. It was a lucky day for this blind person and a meaningful day for the volunteer. Such meticulous attention to the individual passenger reflects its outstanding service of Shanghai Metro towards disabled. I was amoved. And after that, I was inspired to experience volunteer work at a nearby metro station for two weeks. I helped others pass security checks smoothly and guided them in the right direction. I was very busy, it was not as simple as I imagined. During that period, I have met many responsible volunteers. They had many measurements and experiences in volunteering. They played a significant role in maintaining order, safety prevention, and guiding passengers. Shanghai Metro offers a vast platform and a wealth of content for volunteer services.             

Volunteering, like the act I witnessed, is a profound way to contribute to society. As college students,when we volunteer, we are not only fulfilling our social responsibility but also fostering a sense of unity and cooperation. Volunteering provides us with the opportunity to connect with others, to learn from different perspectives, and to work together towards common goals.                                 

Thank you.
